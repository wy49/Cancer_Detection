# Cancer_Detection

This project aims to train a neural network that identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.  

The training dataset is 6GB large and contains 220025 images. Two sample images are uploaded, one contains tumor tissue and one does not.

The network is still in the training process and will keep improving. This page will then update later.
